ensure that all modules are self sufficient

create dir test, and have one test file per class in the module

there should be a way to do the following:

if I am the class X in module X (base namespace),

then I should be able to search through all modules (Y) in the catalog scope and
call Y::X on them.

for example, iptables, calls any modules such as 
  apache::iptables
  puppet::server::iptables

nagios calls
  apache::nagios

and so on.
