# EXTERNAL COMMAND OPTION
# This option allows you to specify whether or not Nagios should check
# for external commands (in the command file defined below).  By default
# Nagios will *not* check for external commands, just to be on the
# cautious side.  If you want to be able to use the CGI command interface
# you will have to enable this.
# Values: 0 = disable commands, 1 = enable commands

check_external_commands=<%= nagiosexternal %>


# EXTERNAL COMMAND CHECK INTERVAL
# This is the interval at which Nagios should check for external commands.
# This value works of the interval_length you specify later.  If you leave
# that at its default value of 60 (seconds), a value of 1 here will cause
# Nagios to check for external commands every minute.  If you specify a
# number followed by an "s" (i.e. 15s), this will be interpreted to mean
# actual seconds rather than a multiple of the interval_length variable.
# Note: In addition to reading the external command file at regularly 
# scheduled intervals, Nagios will also check for external commands after
# event handlers are executed.
# NOTE: Setting this value to -1 causes Nagios to check the external
# command file as often as possible.
