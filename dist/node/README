This module will hold types and providers related to managing node provisioning.

The basic idea is as follows:

  - node 
    - node type
      - name (is this hostname)
      - do we have any control over MAC/ipaddres?
      - memory - amount of memory provisioned
      - disksize
      - ncpus - number of CPUS
      - owner - machines have owners
      - group - information that determines how machine should be parameterized.
      - role - list of classes that define a machines role.
    - linode provider
    - EC2 provider
    - rackspace cloud provider
  - manifests - it doesnt make sense to have any manifests. The providers may need manifests to initialize connections of something (install required APIs and whatnot)
