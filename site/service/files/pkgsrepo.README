Apt
---

For those who would like to run an apt mirror for internal usage, we provide an rsync server for just this purpose.  Other options include running apt-cacher and the like.  The following command will sync our apt repository.

rsync -av --copy-links --del rsync://apt.puppetlabs.com/packages/apt/ /opt/repo/apt/
